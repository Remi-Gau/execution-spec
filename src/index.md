# BIDS Apps execution specification

## The Problem

Neuroimaging is a field with an enormous library of powerful tools
and openly available datasets that can be difficult to get to work together.

## What is BIDS?

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a community-driven
standardized data organization protocol that gives analysis tools a common
specification for data input, see this link. BIDS solves the dataset complexity
problem by providing a consistent representation for data sharing and adoption.

## So why do we need the BIDS Application Specification?

While BIDS is great for
standardizing datasets, analytical tools can take a variety of forms, arguments,
and complexities, limiting their ability to be applied interchangeably. The BIDS
Application Specification solves this problem by creating a community-driven
standardized structure for software definitions and their execution.

## What is this document?

This document is a draft for the BIDS Application
specification for the purposes of tool description, provenance and
reproducibility. This is a working document in draft stage and any comments are
welcome. This document inherits all components of the original specification
(e.g. how to store imaging data, events, stimuli and behavioral data), and
should be seen as an extension of it, not a replacement.

## How can I help?

There are many open comments on the document, and all of them
would benefit from your input. As you read this document, please feel free to
ask questions, complete remaining tasks, or reach out to any of the listed
contributors and moderators.
